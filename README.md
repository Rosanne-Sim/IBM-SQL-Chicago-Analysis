# IBM SQL Final Project — Chicago Data Analysis  

This project explores the relationship between socioeconomic indicators, public school performance, and crime data across Chicago using SQL and Python.  

It was completed as part of IBM’s *Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python* course on Coursera.

### Datasets
1. Census_Data.csv — Socioeconomic indicators in Chicago  
2. Public_Schools.csv — School performance and safety data  
3. Crime_Data.csv — Reported crime records across community areas

### Skills Demonstrated
- SQL joins  
- Aggregations and filtering  
- Subqueries  
- Python–SQLite integration  
- Exploratory data analysis

### How This Project Works
This project was originally completed in IBM’s SQL course using a Jupyter Notebook.  
All datasets were loaded into SQLite tables, and SQL queries (see `queries.sql`) were used to analyze:
- Crime rates by community area  
- School safety versus socioeconomic conditions  
- Relationships between income levels and hardship indexes  

Due to course restrictions, the original notebook and one dataset are not included here, but all core SQL logic and cleaned datasets are preserved in this repository.
