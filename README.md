🏙 IBM SQL Final Project — Chicago Data Analysis

This project explores the relationship between socioeconomic indicators, public school performance, and crime data across Chicago using SQL and Python.
It’s part of IBM’s Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python course on Coursera.

Key Highlights
Queried and joined 3 real-world datasets: Census, Crime, and Schools.
Used SQL in SQLite to extract insights on community hardship, poverty, and crime.
Integrated Python (pandas + ipython-sql) to automate and visualize results.

Datasets
1) Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
2) Chicago Public Schools
3) Chicago Crime Data
   
Skills Demonstrated
SQL joins • Aggregations • Subqueries • Python–SQLite integration • Data analysis

### How this project works
This project was originally completed in IBM’s SQL course using a Jupyter Notebook.  
All datasets were loaded into **SQLite** tables, and SQL queries (see `queries.sql`) were used to analyse:
- crime rates by community area,
- school safety vs socioeconomic conditions,
- and relationships between income levels and hardship indexes.

Due to course restrictions, the original notebook and one dataset are not included here,  
but all **core SQL logic** and cleaned datasets are preserved in this repository.
